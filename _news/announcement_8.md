This fall, I gave several invited talks including two talks at the [Asia Communications and Photonics Conference (ACP)](http://www.acpconf.com/), one at a workshop on [DSP for Optical Fiber Communication](https://real-net.astonphotonics.uk/workshop-on-digital-signal-processing-in-optical-fiber-communication/) and one at a workshop on [Neuromorphic High-Speed Communications](https://www.cel.kit.edu/english/neucos21.php). The slides are now available on my website.
