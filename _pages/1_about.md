I am with the [Communication Systems Group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/communications-antennas-and-optical-networks/) ([@ChalmersComsys](https://twitter.com/ChalmersComsys)) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se) (Sweden). 
Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher and Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow at [Duke University]( https://bigdata.duke.edu/) (USA) and Chalmers. 
I was also a visiting researcher at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/lnt/home/), the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/content/en/sites/oberpfaffenhofen.html), [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/ict-lab), and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/research/optical-networks). 

My research focus is on communication systems, machine learning, error-correcting codes, and signal processing. 
I am a member of the [Fiber-Optic Communication Research Center (FORCE)](https://chalmers.se/force).
