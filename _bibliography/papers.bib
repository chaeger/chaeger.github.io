abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of polarization tracking algorithms in optical transmission systems suffering from fast state of polarization (SOP) rotations and polarization-dependent loss (PDL). While most of the gradient descent (GD)-based algorithms in the literature may require step size adjustment when the channel condition changes, we propose tracking algorithms that can perform similarly or better without parameter tuning. Numerical simulation results show higher robustness of the proposed algorithms to SOP and PDL drift compared to GD-based algorithms, making them promising candidates to be used in aerial fiber links where the SOP can potentially drift rapidly, and therefore becomes challenging to track.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art high-spectral-efficiency communication systems employ high-order modulation formats coupled with high symbol rates to accommodate the ever-growing demand for data rate-hungry applications. However, such systems are more vulnerable to linear and nonlinear transmission impairments, and it is important to mitigate the performance loss via digital signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach for blind channel equalization and estimation using the vector quantized (VQ) \ac{VAE} framework. The proposed approach generalizes the applicability of the conventional \ac{VAE}-based equalizer to nonlinear systems employing high-order modulation formats by introducing a codebook component and an associated novel loss function. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method over a linear additive white Gaussian noise channel with intersymbol interference and two nonlinear scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve similar performance as a data aided equalizer using the \acf{MMSE} criterion, and outperforms the blind\ac{CMA} and the \ac{VAE}-based channel equalizer. Furthermore, we show that for the linear channel, the proposed scheme exhibits better convergence properties than the \ac{MMSE}-based, the \ac{CMA}-based, and the \ac{VAE}-based equalizers in terms of both convergence speed and robustness to variations in training batch size and learning rate.},

abstract = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned to be one of the pillars of 6G. However, 6G is also expected to be severely affected by hardware impairments. Under such impairments, standard model-based approaches might fail if they do not capture the underlying reality. To this end, data-driven methods are an alternative to deal with cases where imperfections cannot be easily modeled. In this paper, we propose a model-driven learning architecture for joint single-target multi-input multi-output (MIMO) sensing and multi-input single-output (MISO) communication. We compare it with a standard neural network approach under complexity constraints. Results show that under hardware impairments, both learning methods yield better results than the model-based standard baseline. If complexity constraints are further introduced, model-driven learning outperforms the neural-network-based approach. Model-driven learning also shows better generalization performance for new unseen testing scenarios.},

abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate a novel size reduction approach for symbol-based look-up table (LUT) digital predistortion (DPD) of the transmitter impairments taking advantage of the periodicity in the pattern-dependent distortions. Compared to other reduced-size LUT schemes, the proposed method can significantly lessen the storage memory requirements with negligible performance penalty for high-order modulation formats. To further alleviate the storage memory restriction, a twice reduced-size LUT scheme is proposed to provide further size reduction. Importantly, given a targeted memory length, we verify the importance of averaging over sufficient occurrences of the patterns to obtain a well-performing LUT. Moreover, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of LUT-based DPD using random data. Finally, we demonstrate a neural network (NN) based nonlinear predistortion technique, which achieves nearly identical performance to the full-size LUT for all employed constellations and is robust against a change of modulation format. The proposed techniques are verified in a back-to-back transmission experiment of 20 Gbaud 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and 1024-QAM signals considering 3 and 5 symbol memory. The performance of the LUT-based DPD is further validated in a noise loading experiment.},

abstract = {We propose an AE-based transceiver for a WDM system impaired by hardware imperfections. We design our AE following the architecture of conventional communication systems. This enables to initialize the AE-based transceiver to have similar performance to its conventional counterpart prior to training and improves the training convergence rate. We first train the AE in a single-channel system, and show that it achieves performance improvements by putting energy outside the desired bandwidth, and therefore cannot be used for a WDM system. We then train the AE in a WDM setup. Simulation results show that the proposed AE significantly outperforms the conventional approach. More specifically, it increases the spectral efficiency of the considered system by reducing the guard band by 37\% and 50\% for a root-raised-cosine filter-based matched filter with 10\% and 1\% roll-off, respectively. An ablation study indicates that the performance gain can be ascribed to the optimization of the symbol mapper, the pulse-shaping filter, and the symbol demapper. Finally, we use reinforcement learning to learn the pulse-shaping filter under the assumption that the channel model is unknown. Simulation results show that the reinforcement-learning-based algorithm achieves similar performance to the standard supervised end-to-end learning approach assuming perfect channel knowledge.},

abstract = {Most of today's communication systems are designed to target reliable message recovery after receiving the entire encoded message (codeword). However, in many practical scenarios, the transmission process may be interrupted before receiving the complete codeword. This paper proposes a novel rateless autoencoder (AE)-based code design suitable for decoding the transmitted message before the noisy codeword is fully received. Using particular dropout strategies applied during the training process, rateless AE codes allow to trade off between decoding delay and reliability, providing a graceful improvement of the latter with each additionally received codeword symbol. The proposed rateless AEs significantly outperform the conventional AE designs for scenarios where it is desirable to trade off reliability for lower decoding delay.},
